# Contributing to QuarantineHeros
We really appreciate your help! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
 - Reporting bugs
 - Proposing new features
 - Submitting bug fixes
 - Implementing features
 
## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub issues to discuss bugs, features, improvements and meta-questions (such as this document). All contributions are submitted with pull requests against **master**.

## If you want to contribute, please:
 - Create an issue, if it doesn't exist yet
 - Ask one of the maintainers (see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)) to be assigned to that issue
 - Discuss your proposed changes in the issue
 - Submit your changes as a pull request against master

## When opening a pull request, please:
1. Ensure that you've discussed your change in a corresponding issue and you've been assigned to this issue by one of 
the maintainers
2. Ensure that any new code is covered by tests. Check out the `/cypress` directory for examples
3. Ensure that your pull request does not introduce any new linting errors. You can run `yarn lint` in your local dev
environment to verify this
4. Only open a pull request if you consider your code to be finished. Do not open "work-in-progress" pull requests, but 
discuss your changes in an issue instead
5. Make sure that your pull request is based against master

## Pull request review
1. Request a review from one or multiple maintainers
2. One of the maintainers will accept the invite for review and will be your main reviewer for this pull request
3. Your reviewer will ask for changes, if necessary. If no more changes seem necessary, your reviewer will accept your changes
4. After accepting your changes, your reviewer will ask for a second pair of eyes from a second maintainer
5. After both maintainers accept your changes, they will be squashed and merged into master

## Any contributions you make will be under AGPL-v3
When you submit code changes, your changes are understood to be under the same AGPL-v3 license that covers this project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern!

## Thank you
Thank you for considering to contribute to QuarantineHeros! We are a group of people wanting to help out in those crazy times!

with those who need help!
