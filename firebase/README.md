# Development

* [Setting up a Node.js development environment](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/setup)
* Firebase uses Node.js version [8.15.10](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/nodejs-8-runtime), so please make sure that you run on the correct Node version (e.g. using `nvm`)
*

## Linting

* to execute the linter, run `npm run lint`
* since we are using `eslint > 6.X.X`, be sure to use Node > 8.10.X, since you will encounter an error [otherwise](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12493#issuecomment-546928948)
